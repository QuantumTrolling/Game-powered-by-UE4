# Game-powered-by-UE4
Introduction:

This project it's a short game, which powered by "Unreal Engine 4". I made this game on subject “fundamental of programming”.

I maid this game as some kind of experiment, for experience and to increase my skills in "object orint programming". So, this project include as "Blueprint classes" and "C++ classes". Moustly, the mechanics of the game are implemented through "Blueprints". In "Blueprints" I mainly used events, which based on overlapping some volumes by other actors.

A few words about gameplay. The player controls the cheracter form third person view. The location is a foggy labyrinth with enemies. The main goal of the player it's "find a way out", for this the player should find and activate white tiles on the floor.

All 3D models with their animations in this project created by me. Other conten like sounds, background music, background picuter in main menu are taken from verified sources.

In conclusion, I wanted to add that it was a wonderfull experience for me in this kind of project.
