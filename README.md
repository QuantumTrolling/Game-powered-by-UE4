# Game-powered-by-UE4
Introduction:

This project it's a short game, which powered by "Unreal Engine 4". I made this game on subject “fundamental of programming”.

I maid this game as some kind of experiment, for experience and to increase my skills in "object orint programming". So, this project include as "Blueprint classes" and "C++ classes". Moustly, the mechanics of the game are implemented through "Blueprints".

All 3D models with their animations in this project created by me.
